## **Decision: Adoption of Time Series Database for Storing Telemetry Data**
**Context**:
- The system requires a database that can efficiently store and process large volumes of telemetry data generated by various sensors in the cloud. This data is time-stamped and needs to be analyzed over time to provide valuable insights.

**Considered Alternatives:**
- Relational databases and NoSQL databases were considered as alternatives. However, they were not chosen due to their less efficient handling of time-stamped data and potential performance issues with large volumes of data.
**Decision:**
- We decided to use a Time Series Database (TSDB) for storing this telemetry data. TSDBs are specifically designed for handling time-stamped data and can provide efficient storage and querying capabilities for such data.

**Rationale**:
- By using a TSDB, we can efficiently store and process large volumes of time-stamped data. This approach allows for efficient data retrieval and analysis over time, which is crucial for our system.
