# Why we chose IoT hub

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Our system is designed to receive sensor data from gateway insalled at customer location.These devices generate a vast amount of data, including telemetry, sensor readings, and commands, which need to be ingested, processed, and acted upon in real-time. Selecting the appropriate IoT platform is critical for ensuring scalability, reliability, security, and interoperability with various IoT devices.

## Decision (decision and justification - the "why")

**Scalability:** Azure IoT Hub is built to handle massive-scale IoT deployments, accommodating millions of devices and handling high-volume data ingestion and processing efficiently.

**Reliability:** Azure IoT Hub provides robust and reliable communication mechanisms, ensuring message delivery with features like device-to-cloud and cloud-to-device messaging retries.

**Security:** Azure IoT Hub offers built-in security features such as device identity management, end-to-end encryption, and device authentication, helping to secure IoT deployments and data.

**Monitoring and Diagnostics:** Azure IoT Hub offers rich monitoring and diagnostics features, including device telemetry monitoring, message routing, and integration with Azure Monitor and Azure Log Analytics for operational insights and troubleshooting.

**Interoperability:** Azure IoT Hub supports various protocols, including MQTT, AMQP, and HTTP, enabling seamless integration with a wide range of IoT devices and platforms.

## Consequences (tradeoff information and any other notable side effects, also impacts)
**Dependency on Azure Ecosystem:** Our reliance on Azure IoT Hub ties us to the Azure ecosystem for IoT-related services and solutions.

**Cost Considerations:** Usage of Azure IoT Hub may incur costs based on factors such as the number of devices, message volume, and additional features utilized.
