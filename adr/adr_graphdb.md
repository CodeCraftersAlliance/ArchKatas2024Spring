## **Decision: Choosing Graph Database as the Preferred Persistent Storage**
**Context**:
Our digital twin database is composed of several interconnected entities: Farm Companies, Farms, Enclosures, Farm Animals, Gateways, Sensors, Cameras, Users, and User Preferences. The relationships between these entities are complex and multi-dimensional, with each entity potentially having multiple connections to others. For example, a Farm Company has multiple Farms, each Farm has multiple Enclosures hosting Farm Animals, and each Farm is connected to a Gateway enabling cloud connectivity. Additionally, each Farm Company has multiple Users, each with their own set of access permissions and preferences.

**Considered Alternatives:**
1. Relational Databases (SQL): While they offer strong consistency and are widely used, the complex relationships in our system would result in numerous join operations, which can be performance-intensive and difficult to manage.
2. NoSQL Databases (Document, Key-Value, Wide-Column): These databases offer scalability and flexibility in data modeling. However, they are not designed to handle complex relationships and interconnected data efficiently.
3. Graph Databases: These databases are designed to store, manage, and query highly connected data. They can efficiently handle complex relationships and provide high performance for relationship-heavy queries.

**Decision:**
We have decided to use a Graph Database as our preferred persistent storage.
**Rationale**:
The decision to use a Graph Database is based on the following reasons:
1. Efficient Handling of Complex Relationships: Graph databases excel at managing interconnected data. They can efficiently handle the complex relationships between our entities.
2. Performance: Graph databases provide high performance for relationship-heavy queries, which are expected in our system.
3. Flexibility: Graph databases offer flexibility in data modeling, allowing us to easily adapt to changes in our system's requirements.
4. Intuitive Data Modeling: The graph model is more intuitive and closely matches our system's real-world model, making it easier to understand and work with.

**Impact:**
The benefits of efficient relationship handling, performance, and flexibility make it a worthwhile choice.
